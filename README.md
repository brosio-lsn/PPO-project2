# JaVelo: Advanced Bike Route Planner

## Overview
JaVelo is an advanced Java application for planning bike routes, specifically designed for the Swiss terrain. This project showcases the use of JavaFX for creating a rich and interactive user interface, resembling popular online planners like Google Maps.

## Technical Highlights
- **JavaFX**: Utilized for crafting a highly interactive and intuitive graphical user interface.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Implemented to calculate the most efficient bike routes, factoring in various terrains and elevations.
- **Topographical Data Analysis**: Integration with Swiss topographical data to provide accurate and realistic route planning.
- **Dynamic Route Modification**: Ability to dynamically add, remove, or adjust waypoints with instant route updates.
- **Night/Day Cycle Simulation**: A unique feature that alters map visibility and route dynamics, simulating real-world conditions.
- **Swiss-Altimetric Model Integration**: Incorporation of SwissALTI3D data for precise elevation details, enhancing the route planning experience.

## Features
- Interactive map enabling extensive route planning with multiple waypoints.
- Optimal route calculation considering road types, bike paths, and topographical features.
- Detailed route profile display with total distance, elevation gains, and losses.
- Real-time route adjustments with automatic recalculation for added or moved waypoints.

## Limitations
- Coverage limited to Swiss territory, leveraging the high-precision and freely available SwissALTI3D altimetric model.
